# autopushpin
Automate the pushing of pins in a push pin toy

# notes so far
I used https://tutorials-raspberrypi.com/how-to-control-a-stepper-motor-with-raspberry-pi-and-l293d-uln2003a/ and https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-10-stepper-motors/configure-and-test (mostly the first one, and maybe none of the second one) to guide my setup. I did change the code a bit so that it worked with my motor.
